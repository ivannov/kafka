*Paper Abstract*: This paper looks into the data persistence consequences of breaking monolith applications into multiple microservices.
The higher scalability and improved lifecycle of separate deployments come with a cost: if data is persisted in a single storage, separate microservices can't be delivered independently; otherwise transaction boundaries can't be used to ensure data consistency.
The paper looks into the different aspects of the data persistence in a microservices application and proposes optimal solutions for specific microservices usecases beyond those mentioned in general distributed systems research.

*Paper Keywords*: microservices, bounded contexts, data persistence, distributed systems, ACID

== 1. Microservice architecture

Microservice architecture is architectural style that approaches developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API <<Fowler,[1]>>.

Microservices are small and autonomous abstractions that are handling particular business context of the big application.
Each one of them can be implemented using different technology and framework.
Separate microservices can be delivered and scaled independently of each other. <<Newman1,[2]>>

It should be considered as the opposite to the monolith approach, where the application is developed, built and delivered as a single unit.
The latter might consist internally of several components and submodules.
But what is essential is that is deployed as a single archive.

We are going to use a sample moderately large web application to illustrate the how a monolith is turned into microservices and what are the challenges that we face after that.
It is a web store that sells goods.
It was very well developed and its functionality was split into a few submodules.
The diagram bellow presents the most important of them:

The application consists of a _Store_ submodule, which takes care of all the goods on sale, their current quantity and price.
Then there is the _User management_ submodule, which responsibility is logging in users, keeping track of their profile information and history.
The _Invoices_ submodule is responsible for getting right issuing invoices upon successful sale.
Last but not least, the _Forum_ submodule provides capabilities to e-store users to comment and rate the goods that are on sale.

The monolith model has its own benefits:

* Communication between submodules is straightforward and is based on API calls
* You deploy just a single artifact and let the target platform (i.e. the application server) take care of loading submodules and their dependencies in the proper order
* Monitoring one system is much easier than monitoring multiple ones.
Same with debugging

However, once the monolith application grows, its development and maintenance becomes more problematic compared to a really modular solutions.
We will give two scenarios which prove that claim.

Let's first come back to the delivery model of the e-store.
It is delivered on a single server (real or virtual, doesn't really matter).
This server needs to be running on powerful hardware to meet the application resource requirements.
If in peak moments you decide to scale the application out by adding a new server, you have to purchase or land the same amount of hardware.
Although the higher system requirements come just from the Store submodule, you must duplicate the whole server.

Another usecase is with updating the application.
As its owner, you are delivering new features and bug fixes on a regular basis.
As part of the monolith, you have to run significant set of tests across all the submodules in order to validate a small bug fix in the invoices generation.
Or introduce unnecessary downtime in the Store for example, when you just want to deliver a small feature in the Forum.
To avoid that, you might decide to deliver features and fixes of all modules together once every two weeks.
But in this way the teams that are working on each submodule would lose the autonomy to deliver capabilities at its own pace.

Developing a monolith applications means sticking to one platform for all the submodules.
This means that if the Store performs best if developed in Java backed by Relational Database, you have to use that for the whole e-store.
No matter that another combination would be more appropriate for any of the other modules.

A microservice architecture can easily solve these problems.
According to Dragoni et al <<Dragoni,[3]>>:

* Scaling a microservice architecture does not imply a duplication of all its components and developers can conveniently deploy/dispose instances of services with respect to their load
* Changing a module of a microservice architecture does not require a complete reboot of the whole system.
The reboot regards only the microservices of that module.
* Microservices impose no additional lock-in and developers can freely choose the optimal resources (languages, frameworks, etc.) for the implementation of each microservice besides the communication protocol used for communication between them

So if we split our submodules into microservices, we can get an architecture that is more flexible to scale and easier to maintain:

Now each individual service can be scaled up and out independently from the others.
The teams that deliver each of them can now be responsible for the whole end-to-end delivery of new features as well as for picking the most suitable technology and framework to implement the respective microservice.

Of course, picking a microservice architectural approach does not come without additional implications.
One such implication is that the microservices are not completely isolated semantically.
Which means that their share common concepts.
For example the users defined in User Management service have their representations in all other modules.

The rest of this paper will explain this implication in depth and will describe and compare possible solutions.
